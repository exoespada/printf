# Custom Printf Function in C: A Learning Project
Learning Project: Custom Printf Function without stdio.h

## Learning Objectives
Welcome to the Custom Printf Function learning project! I'm Peter Pierre Nzioki, often known as Exoespada, and along with my collaborator Brenda, we've embarked on a mission to develop a custom `printf` function in C without using `stdio.h`. By the end of this project, we aim to:

**General**
- Master the art of constructing a `printf` replica without relying on the standard library.
- Understand and efficiently use variable argument functions in C.
- Dive deep into the intricacies of formatting specifiers and variable length argument lists.
- Implement a dynamic buffer system to manage and format output.

**Note**: 
There might be provided `main.c` files for testing your functions. Feel free to utilize them, but they aren't mandatory for pushing to the repository. We might employ a different set of `main.c` files for compilation and testing.

## Special Thanks
We'd like to extend our deepest gratitude to the ALX team for providing such an engaging and challenging project. Your dedication to fostering a deeper understanding of programming is truly appreciated.

We hope this project sparks curiosity and enhances your understanding of C programming intricacies. Dive in, experiment, break things, and learn. Here's to coding, understanding, and mastery!

Warm regards,

Peter Pierre Nzioki (Exoespada) & Brenda.
